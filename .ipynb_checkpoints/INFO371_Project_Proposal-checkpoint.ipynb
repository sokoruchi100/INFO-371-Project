    "The project's goal is to create a text classification model that can detect whether a string of text was generated by a human or an AI. The dataset is called the Human vs. LLM Text Corpus, and contains 5 columns listing the text, source, prompt_id, text_length, and word_count. The source will be used as the label for the classification task. The dataset contains 788922 rows of sample text. We will test various text transformation methods such as binary bag of words, term frequency, tfidf, word2vec. We will then combine that with various classifier models like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and a Deep Neural Network. If we have time, we will also attempt to implement a Transformer-based Classification model. We will also use Cross Validation to evaluate the models and use Grid Search to select parameters. The dataset will be split into a training and test set beforehand, with the test set used to evaluate the model with the highest Cross Validation score, while also being used as little as possible to avoid data leakage."

Schools and other industries that need to distinguish human vs AI generated works face this challenging issue. Our project seeks to solve this problem by creating a model that can determine text as either human or AI generated."
